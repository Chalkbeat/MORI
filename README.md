# The MORI Impact Tracker
MORI stands for Measures of Our Reporting’s Influence. The MORI Impact Tracker is a WordPress plugin to help track and report the impact of your organization's journalism.

## Overview

The MORI Impact Tracker plugin allows you to:
- Record an individual impact and attach it to a particular WordPress post, or to a broader category or tag. Impacts can stand alone, too.
- Review impacts over time. Search and sort them as you would with WordPress posts.
- Export lists of impacts to a spreadsheet, for further data crunching and sharing with internal and external users.

It also includes a dashboard widget to display your latest impacts where anyone working in WordPress can see them regularly.

## Installation

1. Download the zip file from this Github repo and upload the 'chalkbeat-MORI' directory to your WordPress site's plugin directory.
2. Activate the plugin 'MORI - Measures of Our Reporting’s Influence' through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. You can now configure your MORI setup

## What MORI does

MORI creates a WordPress post type -- "Impacts" -- and a taxonomy -- "Impact Type". It also creates some tools for exporting those impacts for analysis.

You use "Impacts" for tracking individual events. Each impact is assigned to a single post or page. MORI links the impact to the post via metadata on the impact.

"Impact Types" are for tracking different types of impacts and operate just like tags. They can be anything you want them to be, such as "award", "legislative action" or even "lawsuit".

Also, MORI allows you to export impacts as a .csv spreadsheet so you can analyze your work. These exports can include data about an impact as well as information about the post or page an impact is assigned to.
