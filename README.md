# Measures of Our Reporting’s Influence (MORI)

## Description

MORI provides a framework for recording the impact your reporting has.

## Installation

1. Download the zip file from this Github repo and upload the 'chalkbeat-MORI' directory to your WordPress site's plugin directory.
2. Activate the plugin 'MORI - Metrics on Reporting Impacts' through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. You can now configure your MORI setup

## What MORI does

MORI creates a WordPress post type -- "Impacts" -- and a taxonomy -- "Impact Type". It also creates some tools for exporting those impacts for analysis.

You use "Impacts" for tracking individual events. Each impact is assigned to a single post or page. MORI links the impact to the post via metadata on the impact.

"Impact Types" are for tracking different types of impacts and operate just like tags. They can be anything you want them to be, such as "award", "legislative action" or even "lawsuit".

Also, MORI allows you to export impacts as a .csv spreadsheet so you can analyze your work. These exports can include data about an impact as well as information about the post or page an impact is assigned to.
