# The Impact post type
Use the Impact post type to track individual impacts of your journalism.

Create an Impact and edit it like a normal post. It can include links, images, and other metadata you might want to use to sort impacts later, such as categories and tags. Impacts are not published for public consumption, only saved in the WordPress database.

Each Impact post can be attached to a post, page, category, or tag, so you can always refer back to the particular story or series of stories that made a difference.

## Details

#### Add an Impact
After your story is published, good things happen, and itâ€™s time to record an Impact. Start by finding the MORI menu in the left sidebar of the administration area and look for Add New Impact.

#### Edit an Impact
Enter a title and description for the Impact. You can use links, add media, formatting, etc. in the description field. Was your story published in a local newspaper? Attach a picture of the front page, grab a screenshot of the web version, link to it, etc. Include the details you want to record to help tell the story of this Impact to your organization's staff, funders, and others.

#### Assign an Impact to a URL
Assign the Impact to a URL on your site. This might be a single post, a page, or another collection of posts, such as a category or tag.

#### Select an Impact Type
Select an Impact Type from the taxonomy menu, usually on the right side of the screen. Notes on setting up your organization's Impact Type taxonomy are [here](https://github.com/Chalkbeat/MORI/blob/master/docs/impact-type-taxonomy.md). This is what Chalkbeat's Impact Type options look like at the time of this writing.

#### Save an Impact
"Publish" to save this Impact. The Impact post type is set up to be invisible to the public, so it shouldn't appear anywhere on your public-facing WordPress site unless you expressly make changes to this code to make that possible.

Your Impact should now have some more metadata assigned to it, including the tags and categories from the post you assigned it to, where applicable. This should make it easier to find and report on impact related to a particular topic.

#### The MORI dashboard widget
After you install the MORI Impact Tracker WordPress plugin and log your first few impacts, you should see a dashboard widget when you log into WordPress. It will display recent impacts and provide links to add a new Impact or view all impacts.

#### View all Impacts
Select "All Impacts" from the MORI menu in WordPress or from the dashboard widget. Viewing all Impacts will take you to a familiar list of posts, where you can sort by various criteria, edit if needed, or otherwise update taxonomies and other information.
