# The Impact post type
Use the Impact post type to track individual impacts of your journalism.

Create an Impact and edit it like a normal post. It can include links, images, and other metadata you might want to use to sort impacts later, such as categories and tags. Impacts are not published for public consumption, only saved in the WordPress database.

Each Impact post can be attached to a post, page, category, or tag, so you can always refer back to the particular story or series of stories that made a difference.

## Details
1. After your story is published, good things happen, and itâ€™s time to record an Impact. Start by finding the MORI menu in the left sidebar of the administration area and look for Add New Impact.

2. Enter a title and description for the Impact. You can use links, add media, formatting, etc. in the description field. Was your story published in a local newspaper? Attach a picture of the front page, grab a screenshot of the web version, link to it, etc. Include the details you want to record to help tell the story of this Impact to your organization's staff, funders, and others.

3. Assign the Impact to a URL on your site. This might be a single post, a page, or another collection of posts, such as a category or tag.

4. Select an Impact Type from the taxonomy menu, usually on the right side of the screen. Notes on setting up your organization's Impact Type taxonomy are [here](https://github.com/Chalkbeat/MORI/blob/master/docs/impact-type-taxonomy.md). This is what Chalkbeat's Impact Type options look like at the time of this writing.

5. "Publish" to save this Impact. The Impact post type is set up to be invisible to the public, so it shouldn't appear anywhere on your public-facing WordPress site unless you expressly make changes to this code to make that possible.
