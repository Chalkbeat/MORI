# The Impact Type taxonomy
Impact Types are for tracking different types of impacts and operate just like tags. They can be anything you want them to be, such as "award", "legislative action" or even "lawsuit".

Configure the Impact Types for your site in the MORI Settings.

## Details
#### Choose 'Impact Types' from the MORI menu in WordPress.

#### Add an Impact Type
If you're familiar with [managing taxonomies in WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Manage_Categories_SubPanel), such as categories or tags, this screen should look familiar. Add Impact Types, and then you'll be able to assign them to Impacts.

## Impact Type taxonomy examples
The Chalkbeat team uses an education-specific Impact taxonomy that includes two major divisions of categories: Impacts where we informed action, and Impacts where we informed debate.

Under the heading of 'Informed Action,' we include things like lawsuits, policy changes, government investigations, and more categories where actions are taken as a result of our reporting.

'Informed Debate' covers various forms of citations, credits, links, pickups, mentions, and at times, republication of our stories in other news and information sources.

|Informed Action  	|Description  	|
|---	|---	|
|Formal protest or petition   	|This can be any protest or petition that occurs in a formal setting, like a school or a meeting or at City Hall or Statehouse. It can also be an online petition that has been formally created and distributed.   	|
|Government investigation   	|If the government officially decides to investigate an issue we’ve reported on. This can also include government hearings.    	|
|Institutional action   	|These include firings, hirings or reorganizations, etc.   	|
|Lawsuit filed   	|When a lawsuit is filed that relates in any way to reporting we have done.   	|
|Legislative action   	|If a story we write, leads to an action in the local, state or federal legislature — such as a law change or bill introduced.   	|
|School- or classroom-level change in policy or practice   	|When a classroom or school makes a change in its policies or practice. (e.g., change in programming, teaching, school-wide policy)   	|
|State- or district-level change in policy or practice   	|When the state or a district makes a change in its policies or in its practice. (e.g., change in rules, regulations, budgeting)   	|

|Informed Debate  |Description  |
|---	|---	|
|Award   	|Any type of award won or a nomination.   	|
|Non-press organization cites our work in a report   	|A government entity, nonprofit/advocacy organization, researcher or school cites Chalkbeat’s work in a formal, published report.   	|
|Public official refers to report   	|This can be formally (e.g. through public statement or private document) or informally (e.g. through verbal feedback).|
|Chalkbeat staffer makes a public appearance or interview   	|This can be for a media outlet or any other type of organization.   	|
|Story picked up by another publication or organization   	|A pickup is when our stories influence the news cycle because they have been picked up or cited by another influencer (e.g. news organization, blog, foundation, school district or other influential group). If the influencer doesn't cite Chalkbeat, but you know they are writing the story because of our exclusive reporting, it counts as a pickup.   	|

This taxonomy works for Chalkbeat; your mileage may vary.
