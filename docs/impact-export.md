# Exporting Impacts
MORI allows you to export impacts as a .csv spreadsheet so you can analyze your work. These exports can include data about an impact as well as information about the post or page an impact is assigned to. This comes in handy for sharing impact data with internal users, such as your fundraising or management team, and perhaps external users such as funders, where appropriate.
